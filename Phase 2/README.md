# Phase 2
## 2.1 - Intermediate Code Generation
This phase deals with the intermediate code generation in three address code and quadruple form.  

It also shows any errors that are present. If you miss a semicolon or a bracket, it raises an error and shows that there is an error in the input source code.  

## 2.2 - Code Optimization
This phase uses the intermediate code generated by the previous phase and optimizes this to reduce the number of instructions and speedup the entire compilation process.
