# mini-cpp-compiler
## Overview
This is a mini compiler that compiles c++ files. We have made use of lex(flex) and yacc(bison) to implement this. This compiler can handle if, if else, else, while and for loop constructs. It also performs error reporting without stopping as soon as it finds an error.
